# Investigate-tmdb-movies-dataset
This is a movie data set containing important information about 10,000 movies collected from The Movie Database (TMDb). The dataset contains 10866 rows and 21 columns of information about the movies. This information in this data set is useful in understanding why and how movies become top sellers or a failure. Similarly, the dataset is useful in machine learning to predict the success of a movie.
To analyze the dataset, I asked the following questions: 
1) how many movies were released per year?
2) How much was grossed per year of production?
3) Which genre is the most produced?
4) How much did highest grossing movie make?
5) What are the most profitable movies?
6) Which movies received the highest rating by votes?

Explorative data analytic tools were used to investigate these questions. Before analysis the data was cleaned, null values were dropped, decimal numbers were round up to 2 places and duplicates were also dropped. To further get more details, a new column called “profit” was created. The  investigation concludes with finding answers to the question posed.
